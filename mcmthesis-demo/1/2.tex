\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}
%这一部分就是把要解决的问题再重新说一遍或者文献综述，视情况而定
%分点最好
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Problem 1:} Establish a carbon sequestration model to calculate how much carbon dioxide a forest system and its products can sequester, and choose the most efficient forest management plan for carbon dioxide sequestration based on the model.

\item \textbf{Problem 2:} Build a decision model to balance the diverse values of forests so that forest managers can make the best use of forest resources.

\item \textbf{Problem 3:} Take consideration of harvesting in the management plan and observe the model results by applying the model to specific forests.

%\item \textbf{Problem 4:} Write a nontechnical newspaper article to explain the reason for harvesting and convince the local community to make a wise decision for their forest. 

\end{itemize}
